# Question: How do you implement an event queue with prioritized events? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code implements an event queue with prioritized events using two classes: PriorityQueue and EventQueue. The PriorityQueue class is used to manage the queue of events, where each event is an object with two properties: the event itself and its priority. The PriorityQueue class has three methods: enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty. The enqueue method adds an event to the queue based on its priority. If the queue is not empty, it iterates over the queue and inserts the new event at the correct position according to its priority. If the queue is empty or the new event has the lowest priority, it is added at the end of the queue. The dequeue method removes and returns the first event in the queue (which is the event with the highest priority). The isEmpty method checks if the queue is empty. The EventQueue class is a wrapper around the PriorityQueue class, providing a more user-friendly interface for adding events (addEvent method), getting the next event (nextEvent method), and checking if the queue is empty (isEmpty method). The code then creates an instance of the EventQueue class, adds three events with different priorities, and logs each event to the console in order of their priority.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. The main difference is that TypeScript includes type annotations, which provide static type checking. This can help catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.

In the TypeScript version, the `PriorityQueue` class has a private property `queue` of type `any[]` (an array of any type), and the `enqueue` method takes two parameters: `item` of type `any` and `priority` of type `number`. Similarly, the `EventQueue` class has a private property `queue` of type `PriorityQueue`, and the `addEvent` method takes two parameters: `event` of type `any` and `priority` of type `number`.

Another difference is that the `isEmpty` method in the TypeScript version uses the `===` operator to compare `this.queue.length` to `0`, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `!` operator to negate `this.queue.length`. This is a minor difference and both versions effectively check whether the queue is empty.

Finally, the TypeScript version uses `let` to declare the `eventQueue` variable, whereas the JavaScript version uses `const`. This is also a minor difference and doesn't affect the functionality of the code. The `let` keyword allows the variable to be reassigned, but in this case, the variable is not reassigned.

# C++ Differences

The JavaScript version uses a custom implementation of a priority queue, where each event is an object with an event and priority property. The enqueue method iterates over the queue to find the correct position to insert the new event based on its priority. If no such position is found, the event is added at the end of the queue. The dequeue method removes and returns the first event in the queue. The isEmpty method checks if the queue is empty.

The C++ version uses the built-in priority_queue from the Standard Template Library (STL). Each event is an instance of a custom struct Event, which has a priority and name property. The struct also has a custom less-than operator for comparing events based on their priority. The priority_queue automatically sorts the events based on their priority, so there's no need to manually find the correct position when adding a new event. The top method returns the event with the highest priority, and the pop method removes this event from the queue. The empty method checks if the queue is empty.

The main differences between the two versions are:

1. The JavaScript version uses a custom implementation of a priority queue, while the C++ version uses the built-in priority_queue from the STL.

2. The JavaScript version uses objects for events and manually finds the correct position to insert a new event, while the C++ version uses a custom struct for events and relies on the priority_queue to automatically sort the events.

3. The JavaScript version uses the shift method to remove and return the first event in the queue, while the C++ version uses the top and pop methods to return and remove the event with the highest priority.

4. The JavaScript version uses the length property to check if the queue is empty, while the C++ version uses the empty method.
